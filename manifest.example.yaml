# Package lookup backend to use:
# pacman, dpkg, homebrew, pkgng, or noop.

# The special value noop will assume all packages are installed.

# Default: attempt to autodetect, fallback to noop.

# Operations to perform by type.
#
# Operations always happen in this order: unlinks, directories, files, and symlinks.
#
# Each type of operations waits until the previous type has completed successfully.

# Operations of each type with equal order value are always done in parallel
# # but operations with a later order do not start until earlier ones complete.
#
# Specifying an array of hostnames will restrict that
# operation to matching hosts (case insensitive).
#
# Specifying an array of packages will restrict that
# operation to hosts with all packages installed (case insensitive).
#
# All operation types will default to an empty array if unset.
